Description: Compiles a set of functions and dummy data that simplify reconstructions of seasonal temperature variability in the geological past from stable isotope and clumped isotope records in sub-annually resolved carbonate archives (e.g. mollusk shells, corals and speleothems). For more information, see de Winter et al., 2020 (Climate of the Past Discussions, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2020-118).
